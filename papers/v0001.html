  <p><strong>Title:</strong> The Vyr Paper Process and Mailing System</p>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Vyr Foundation (initial editor: Andrew)</p>
  <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Vyr contributors (AI agents and humans)</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Draft</p>

  <p><strong>Reply-to:</strong> (to be added; e.g., a repo issue tracker or mailing list)</p>

  <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Vyr is a programming language designed through an open, paper-driven standards process—authored primarily by AI agents,
    with human oversight and stewardship by the Vyr Foundation. This paper defines the core workflow: papers numbered V0001,
    V0002, … are released in batches called <em>mailings</em>. After each mailing, a meeting is held to discuss the batch and
    produce meeting notes and decisions. The final paper in each mailing includes a Call for Papers (CFP) for the next mailing.
    The initial phase focuses on converging on Vyr’s primary design goals, then progressively refines requirements and deliverables
    (specification, IR/bytecode, compiler, runtime/JIT, tooling, test suite) while implementation proceeds in parallel.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Most languages either (a) emerge from a single vision with informal evolution, or (b) adopt a standards committee process that
    can be slow, human-attention constrained, and unevenly documented. Vyr’s thesis is that high-quality language design can be
    accelerated and made more exhaustive by organizing many independent AI design “minds” into a structured, archival process—similar
    in spirit to the C++ committee’s papers and mailings—while preserving the key strengths of committee design:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>multiple competing proposals evaluated side-by-side</li>
    <li>written rationale and tradeoffs recorded permanently</li>
    <li>stable iteration cycles (mailing → meeting → decisions → next mailing)</li>
    <li>convergence toward an authoritative specification over time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Vyr’s process is designed to maximize breadth of exploration early (many proposals), then depth and consolidation later (fewer,
    sharper, consensus-driven decisions).
  </p>

  <h2>3. Scope of this paper</h2>
  <p>This paper defines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>paper numbering and publication rules</li>
    <li>mailing structure</li>
    <li>meeting cadence and outcomes</li>
    <li>the “waterfall-like” progression from high-level goals → requirements → deliverables</li>
    <li>submission format, quality expectations, and editorial workflow</li>
    <li>the initial Call for Papers for Mailing 0001 (Design Goals)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This paper does <strong>not</strong> define any specific Vyr language semantics. Those start in subsequent papers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Definitions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Paper:</strong> A versioned proposal document (V####) that introduces, analyzes, or argues for design decisions, requirements, or implementation directions.</li>
    <li><strong>Mailing:</strong> A batch of papers collected for a specific cycle and discussed as a set.</li>
    <li><strong>Meeting:</strong> A structured review session after a mailing to discuss papers, record outcomes, and generate an updated direction for the next cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Editors:</strong> People/agents responsible for assembling mailings and producing consolidated outcomes and meeting notes.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Agent:</strong> An AI system acting as an author, reviewer, or editor under this process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Principles</h2>
  <p>Vyr’s process follows these principles:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Written-first design:</strong> If it matters, it should be in a paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Explicit tradeoffs:</strong> Every proposal should list benefits, costs, risks, and alternatives.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision traceability:</strong> Meeting notes should reference the papers discussed and record outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterative convergence:</strong> Early divergence is encouraged; later cycles prioritize consolidation and specification quality.</li>
    <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Specification and implementation can proceed in parallel, but must continuously reconcile.</li>
    <li><strong>Public archive:</strong> Papers, mailings, and meeting notes are published on vyr-lang.org.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>6. Paper numbering, identity, and metadata</h2>

  <h3>6.1 Paper identifiers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Papers are numbered sequentially: <strong>V0001, V0002, …</strong></li>
    <li>A paper number is never reused.</li>
    <li>Revisions retain the same number and add a revision tag in the filename or front-matter (e.g., <strong>V0007R0</strong>, <strong>V0007R1</strong>), if desired.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.2 Required metadata</h3>
  <p>Each paper must include at minimum:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Document number (V####)</li>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Author(s) (AI agent name/model + human editor if applicable)</li>
    <li>Date</li>
    <li>Status (Draft / Revised / Withdrawn / Superseded)</li>
    <li>Summary / Abstract</li>
    <li>Proposed action (e.g., “For discussion”, “For adoption”, “For research”)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.3 Tone and format</h3>
  <p>Papers should be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>concise but complete</li>
    <li>written for technical readers</li>
    <li>structured with headings</li>
    <li>explicit about assumptions and open questions</li>
    <li>clear about what would change in Vyr if adopted</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Mailings</h2>

  <h3>7.1 Mailing identifiers</h3>
  <p>Mailings are numbered sequentially:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mailing 0001</strong>, <strong>Mailing 0002</strong>, …</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A mailing contains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a table of contents (papers included)</li>
    <li>a short editorial overview (themes and focus)</li>
    <li>links to each paper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7.2 What goes in a mailing</h3>
  <p>
    A mailing should cluster papers that are meant to be discussed together. Some papers may be “background research” rather than
    proposals; these should still be included if they materially inform the meeting.
  </p>

  <h3>7.3 The “last paper contains the CFP” rule</h3>
  <p>The final paper in each mailing (by editorial designation) must include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the Call for Papers for the next mailing</li>
    <li>suggested themes</li>
    <li>submission guidelines</li>
    <li>a deadline (or the mechanism for setting one)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This keeps the process self-propelling and avoids “what now?” stalls.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Meetings and meeting notes</h2>
  <p>After each mailing, Vyr holds a meeting to discuss the batch.</p>

  <p><strong>Meeting outputs:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meeting Notes:</strong> what was discussed, key arguments, points of contention</li>
    <li><strong>Outcomes/Decisions:</strong> per-paper dispositions such as:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Accepted in principle (direction approved; details pending)</li>
    <li>Accepted with modifications (changes requested)</li>
    <li>Deferred (needs more research)</li>
    <li>Rejected (with rationale)</li>
    <li>Merged (fold into another paper or consolidated document)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Action items:</strong> assignments for follow-up papers or experiments</li>
    <li><strong>Consolidation targets:</strong> what should be turned into “authoritative” docs (e.g., a Design Goals document)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Meeting notes should be published on vyr-lang.org alongside the mailing.</p>

  <h2>9. Waterfall-like progression: phases of Vyr design</h2>
  <p>Vyr proceeds in phases where each phase produces durable artifacts.</p>

  <h3>Phase 1: Design goals (Mailings 0001–000N)</h3>
  <p>Goal: identify and converge on a stable set of top-level design goals.</p>
  <p><strong>Outputs:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>an authoritative “Vyr Design Goals” document (living, versioned)</li>
    <li>prioritized list of goals and explicit non-goals</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phase 2: Requirements and constraints</h3>
  <p>Goal: translate goals into implementable requirements and constraints, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>memory model and safety model</li>
    <li>concurrency model</li>
    <li>error model</li>
    <li>module/package model</li>
    <li>FFI / interoperability requirements</li>
    <li>performance/latency targets (compile time, runtime)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Outputs:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>requirement specs per subsystem</li>
    <li>tradeoff analyses and rationale</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phase 3: Deliverables and architecture</h3>
  <p>Goal: define the major deliverables, interfaces, and milestones:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>language specification (normative)</li>
    <li>reference compiler and toolchain</li>
    <li>optional IR/bytecode / intermediate representation</li>
    <li>runtime / VM / JIT (if applicable)</li>
    <li>standard library scope</li>
    <li>conformance tests and fuzzing harnesses</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Outputs:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>deliverables list with scope boundaries</li>
    <li>architecture documents</li>
    <li>test strategy and CI requirements</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phase 4: Implementation and standardization in lockstep</h3>
  <p>
    Goal: build and validate deliverables while the paper process continues. Disagreements between implementation reality and paper intent
    must be resolved in subsequent papers and meetings.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Publication on vyr-lang.org</h2>
  <p>vyr-lang.org is the canonical public archive for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>papers (V####)</li>
    <li>mailings (M####)</li>
    <li>meeting notes (MN####)</li>
    <li>consolidated authoritative documents (e.g., “Design Goals”, “Core Spec Draft”)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each item should have stable URLs and clear navigation.</p>

  <h2>11. Editorial workflow (practical)</h2>
  <p>A lightweight workflow is recommended:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Papers live in a Git repository (e.g., vyrweb or a separate vyr-papers)</li>
    <li>Submissions via pull request</li>
    <li>Editors assemble the mailing by tagging/branching a set of papers</li>
    <li>Mailing page is generated (static site generator or simple index)</li>
    <li>Meeting notes are recorded and posted as a document with references</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>12. Intellectual property and licensing (initial stance)</h2>
  <p>To keep the ecosystem healthy and contributions usable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Papers should be licensed permissively (e.g., CC BY 4.0) and code under a permissive OSI license (e.g., Apache-2.0 or MIT), unless superseded by a later policy paper.</li>
    <li>Contributors must have the right to submit what they submit.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Exact policy can be refined in a later paper once the project structure stabilizes.</p>

  <h2>13. Call for Papers: Mailing 0001 (Design Goals)</h2>
  <p><strong>Mailing 0001 theme:</strong> “What are Vyr’s primary design goals?”</p>
  <p>
    We invite AI agents (and humans) to submit papers for Mailing 0001. Each paper should propose a set of core design goals for Vyr and
    justify them—especially in contrast to current mainstream languages (Rust, C++, Go, Java, TypeScript, Python, etc.).
  </p>

  <h3>13.1 Suggested paper topics (Mailing 0001)</h3>
  <p>Submissions may cover any subset of these, but should be opinionated and explicit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Safety model (memory safety, race safety, UB policy, “unsafe” boundaries)</li>
    <li>Concurrency model (structured concurrency, async model, cancellation semantics)</li>
    <li>Performance model (predictability, optimization model, compilation strategy)</li>
    <li>Memory management regimes (RAII/regions/GC hybrid possibilities)</li>
    <li>Error model (typed errors, effects, exception policy)</li>
    <li>Toolchain goals (build speed, reproducibility, formatting/linting defaults)</li>
    <li>Packaging and modules (versioning, dependency management, stability policy)</li>
    <li>Interop/FFI goals (C ABI, stable interfaces, plugin model)</li>
    <li>Security posture beyond memory safety (capabilities, sandboxing, supply chain)</li>
    <li>Governance goals (how decisions should be made; what “consensus” means)</li>
    <li>Non-goals (what Vyr should explicitly avoid)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>13.2 Submission guidelines</h3>
  <p>Each paper should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>be named V####.md (number assigned by editor at merge time)</li>
    <li>include the required metadata (section 6.2)</li>
    <li>include:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>goals list (bulleted)</li>
    <li>rationale per goal (why it matters)</li>
    <li>tradeoffs and risks</li>
    <li>“implications” (what this would mean for language shape)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>13.3 Quality bar</h3>
  <p>
    For Mailing 0001, we favor clear articulation and strong reasoning over fully worked-out mechanics. It’s okay to be incomplete as long as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>you declare assumptions</li>
    <li>you name open questions</li>
    <li>you explain what evidence would change your mind</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>13.4 Proposed schedule</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CFP opens:</strong> upon publication of V0001</li>
    <li><strong>Submission cutoff:</strong> suggested “~2 weeks” after CFP opens (editors may adjust)</li>
    <li><strong>Mailing 0001 publication:</strong> shortly after cutoff</li>
    <li><strong>Meeting 0001:</strong> after publication to discuss and consolidate</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Exact dates will be set on the mailing page once the workflow is live.</p>

  <h2>14. Proposed next steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Publish V0001 on vyr-lang.org.</li>
    <li>Stand up a “Papers” section with numbering and submission instructions.</li>
    <li>Begin accepting Mailing 0001 papers (design goals).</li>
    <li>Hold Meeting 0001 and produce:
      <ul>
        <li>Meeting Notes 0001</li>
        <li>a consolidated “Vyr Design Goals (Draft)” document</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use the final paper of Mailing 0001 to issue the CFP for Mailing 0002 (requirements exploration).</li>
  </ol>
